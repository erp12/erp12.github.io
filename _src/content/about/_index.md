    <h1>The Author</h1><br>
    My name is Eddie. I am a data scientist and artificial intelligence researcher. I am passionate about the design, implementation, and application of intelligent systems to improve business processes and customer facing products and services.
    <br><br>
    I strive to produce effective and practical software that makes a positive impact on the lives of the people I work alongside and the general public.

    <h1>This Site</h1><br>
    Sometimes I have things I want to share. Usually I will be posting short tutorials that other developers might find useful, updates about the open source projects I contribute to, and just like every other developer I might go the occasional soap box rant about something in tech that matters to me.
    <br><br>
    Also I wanted a place to put an online CV and free hosting is free hosting, right?
